### Built with

- Node.js
- Express
-

### What I learned

- It is a common practice to use app.js with Express not index.js
- Have not been able to get Postman application to open on my Mac. I know that I have used the app successfully as recently as July. Tried downloading it again and it worked but then would not relaunch the next time I tried to use it. Doing all the building, testing with the web version.
- Some good practices to follow. Put a version on all your APIs so that you do not break an API that someone else is using. The example below is v1 and if later on I wanted to play around with something then I would use v2.

  `app.get('/api/v1/tours');`
